            <h2>Our Aquarium</h2>
                <p>Our expansive aquarium housing over 100 species of sea animals is separate from our biomes housing land animals! Some examples of exciting animals you get to experience firsthand include the bull shark or <em>Carcharhinus leucas</em> called scientifically. So many wonders await the whole family in our aquarium that you will be left amazed!</p>

            <h2>Safety</h2>
                <p>As with our enclosures, we value safety and guidelines above all else to ensure happy safe environments for our customers and creatures alike. We use an ultra-thick glass alloy that allows crystal clear viewing with no light refraction without the risk of cracking from pressure. Every aquarium exhibit is independently controlled down to the temperature and oxidation levels to ensure every animal lives as close to its original environment as possible.</p>
                <p>We feed our fish with top-of-the-line ingredients and meals sourced ethically from around the globe. Some ingredients we even make here!
                    When it comes to cleaning tanks we still utilize ASE as mentioned on our <a href="enclosure.html">Enclosures page.</a><br>
                    Aquarium access comes packaged with a ticket to the entrance of the park</p>
