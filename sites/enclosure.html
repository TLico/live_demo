    <h2>Safety</h2>    
    <p>Our exhibits are all state-of-the-art and extremely safe! We are <em>very</em> serious about safety, we use social distancing and keep cleaning priorities in place to ensure every surface on location is sanitized!</p>
    <p>The 3 step process we go by is:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Analyze each enclosure to see any issues or messes that need to be cleaned</li>
        <li>Strategize a solution and way to clean each enclosure</li>
        <li>Execute a plan to accurately and efficiently clean the enclosure while maintaining proper safety</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Safety and Regulations are taken extremely seriously at the Lakland Zoo, visitors will be removed from the premises if they are caught violating safety guidelines.</strong></p>
